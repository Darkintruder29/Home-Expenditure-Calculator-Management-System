# Expenditure-Calculator-Management-System

This Python program tracks and manages user income and expenses by acting as a Home Expenditure Calculator & Management System. To record information such monthly income, expenses, and savings, it establishes a connection with a MySQL database. Users can estimate income tax based on salary, compute compound interest on savings, compute EMI for loans, view historical spending data, and calculate their savings. The application also uses MySQL for data storage and manipulation and provides features like pie chart generation to help users visualise spending and savings, guaranteeing effective financial management.
